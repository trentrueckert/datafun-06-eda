## Overview

Project 6 is an opportunity to create your own custom exploratory data analysis (EDA) project using GitHub, Git, Jupyter, pandas, Seaborn and other popular data analytics tools.

## Starting the Project: Create and Manage Virtual Project Environment

* Create and name the repository including a default README.md
* Clone it to your machine and include a .gitignore file
* Update the README.md with the process so far
* Use a terminal to add, commit, and push these changes to GitHub

## Chosen Dataset and Description

The "car_crashes" dataset provides information about U.S. car crashes, including by state. There are different columns including crashes involving speeding, alcohol, the lack of distraction, insurance premium, insurance losses, state population, and area of the state. It is used to analyze the 'why' behind many accidents, and the relationships between the variables.
